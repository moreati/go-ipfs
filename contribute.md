# Contribute

go-ipfs is MIT licensed open source software. We welcome contributions big and
small! Take a look at the [community contributing notes](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/contributing.md). Please make sure to check the [issues](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues). Search the closed ones
before reporting things, and help us with the open ones.

Guidelines:

- see the [dev pseudo-roadmap](dev.md)
- please adhere to the protocol described in [the main ipfs repo](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) and [paper](http://static.benet.ai/t/ipfs.pdf).
- please make branches + pull-request, even if working on the main repository
- ask questions or talk about things in [Issues](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues) or #ipfs on freenode.
- ensure you are able to contribute (no legal issues please-- we'll probably setup a CLA)
- run `go fmt` before pushing any code
- run `golint` and `go vet` too -- some things (like protobuf files) are expected to fail.
- if you'd like to work on ipfs part-time (20+ hrs/wk) or full-time (40+ hrs/wk), contact [@jbenet](https://github.com/jbenet)
- have fun!
